1
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,300
There was an idea.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,400
To bring together...

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,500
A group of remarkable people.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,500
To see if we could become...

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,000
Something more.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,560
So when they needed us...

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,100
...we could fight the battles...

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,420
...that they never could.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,400
In time...

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,980
You will know what it's like to lose.

11
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,960
To feel so desperately that you're right...

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,440
...yet to fail...

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,140
...all the same.

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,360
Dread it.

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,680
Run from it.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,460
Destiny still arrives.

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,720
Evacuate the city.

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,760
Engage all defenses.

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,120
And get this man a shield.

20
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,360
Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,560
But this...

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,200
Does put a smile on my face.

23
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,520
Who the hell are you guys?
